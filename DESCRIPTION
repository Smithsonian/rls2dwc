Description: Converts Reef Life Survey Excel workbooks into Darwin Core compatible terms and files. This r package is a utility
    for extracting data from completed Reef Life Survey (https://reeflifesurvey.com/) datasheets. It validates the species names
    using the World Register of Marine Species (WorMS) r package (http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxlist) and converts
    the data into a Darwin Core (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/) compatible format for submission to the Ocean Biogeographic Information
    system (www.iobis.org).
